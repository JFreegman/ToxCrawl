# toxcrawler
toxcrawler is a [Tox](https://tox.chat) DHT network crawler.

## Crawler
The crawler crawls the DHT network with multiple concurrent instances, allowing for a steady stream of up-to-date data on the number of active DHT notes on the network at any given time. When a crawler instance completes its mission, a log file containing all space separated IP addresses that it found is created in the `crawler_logs/{currentdate}/` directory, with the name `{timestamp}.cwl`.

### Compiling
Compile and install the [DHT-addon branch](https://github.com/JFreegman/toxcore/tree/DHT-addon) of toxcore using the given instructions.
Clone this repo to the same base directory as toxcore, then run the command `make` in the `crawler` directory.

### Errors
- If no nodes are returning you are unable to bootstrap to the tox DHT network.  This may be due to firewall settings.
- If when compiling you get the following error:`Package libtoxcore was not found in the pkg-config search path.` Export `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`: `export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig`.
